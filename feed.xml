  I've already tried documenting how I've worked this project out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lPEZ2S2H9H7TzRyUsoujRQBjT8gLaeGs/view?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;MS Word document&lt;/a&gt;. 
  Plus, &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OlRWm-wyYyH6370BLH9LoysII9_l6aIv/view?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Architectural design&lt;/a&gt; is also available just in case the img above is too small to see.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Think and plan ahead before action&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  During the project, I think I got confused a lot especially about the details of a design.
  And I think it is because I really haven't thought my design through before the start of 
  implementation phase. In other words, the initial skeleton design lacked details.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As a result, I had to design the lacked details along the way during the implmentation 
  phase which caused lot of confusion and inefficiency.
  I don't think I still can design 100% eveyrthing perfectly from the start.
  Obviously, there can be some errors and trials at some point with regards to the design.
  But, it would've been not that chaotic as I've gone through this time, if I had carefully designed
  the skeleton in the initial design phase. I was just rushed to put something out there, being impatient.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 So, if I do the project next time, I will probably try to put more time and effort in the 
 initial design phase to minimize the possible confusion which can incur during the next
 implmentation phase.

  오늘 드디어 내 생애 첫 블로그를 완공했다. 지난 주 월요일부터 대충 일주일 정도
  걸린 셈인데.. 만들어놓고 나니 후련하기도 하고 또 내 딴에 새끼(?)라고 자꾸
  눈이가고 뭔가 자꾸 또 뜯어고치고 싶다. &lt;strike&gt;(다메다요 브라더)&lt;/strike&gt; 이제
  그만 자제해야겠지.. 디자이너가 될거는 아니자나.. 코딩도 할게 산더미인데,
  어찌됬건 이번 프로젝트를 통해 HTML/CSS는 대충 연습한 것 같고
  &lt;strike
    &gt;(사실 HTML/CSS 보다는 Jekyll 이랑 다른 여타 잡다한 것들을 픽업하느라 대부분
    시간을 보낸듯.. 아 그리고 쓸데없이 꺠알 디자인 해보겠다 시간낭비..)&lt;/strike
  &gt;
  다음 단계인 자바스크립트를 본격적으로 파야겠다. 그리고 복습이 끝나면 다음
  프로젝트를 생각해보면 되겠지.. 흠..
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  아 그리고 쓰다 알게 된 건데 이 핸드라이팅 폰트고 스탠다드 폰트고 한글은 지원을
  안하는구나.. 한글을 위한 폰트를 또 따로 찾아야되나(귀찮) 그리고 한글이랑
  영어를 동시에 쓰게되면 토글 버튼을 만들어서 선택적으로 볼 수 있게 해주고
  싶은데.. 이렇게 하나하나 추가하다보면 정말 이 블로그 프로젝트는 끝이 없을
  듯하다. 사실 다크모드도 한 번 구현해보고 싶었는데..
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  그동안 블로그 프로젝트에 하루종일 매달리느라 자료구조/알고리즘 릿콧 문제푸는걸
  거의 안하다시피 했는데, 내일부터는 아니 이거 쓰고나서 오늘밤 부터라도 다시
  불을 붙여서 열심히 풀도록 해야겠다. 갈 길이 멀다!

  Finally, I see the end of this project though there won't be end if i really
  purse the perfection. But, at least for now, except the fixed ^Top icon
  button, Basic functionalities of blog are implemented I think. More than
  anything, I found myself spending too much time mostly on visual design, which
  shouldn't be my priority though I enjoyed doing it. I've got tons of things to
  learn and I am still even not good with Javascript. So I think i will just
  wrap this project up this point.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Since I started building this blog up last Monday. It took exactly about a
  week for me to build this blog. I really didn't expect it to take this much
  time since I already knew how to create static pages with html/css/js.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It took a bit of time until I feel like digging a rabbit hole. Firstly, I
  learnt that Github Pages is run with Jekyll, so I picked it up. Soon, I also
  realized that I need to use bit of Liquid to use Jekyll efficiently.. So i
  picked up bit of Liquid and that wasnt the end of course. Jekyll Plugins, Git
  submodule, Travis CI.. I've learnt much more than I expected from the project.
  I still don't think I really picked up Everything completly. But, at least, I
  think I understand most of them on a conceptual level and I feel now bit
  confident with Jekyll and Liquid though I am not sure when I will use it again
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Since I started studying CS at Uni, I really didn't have enough time or mental
  energy. I managed to pass the courses fortunetely, but was mostly at the brink
  of mental breakdown due to my personal problems. Thanks to Corona virus, now I
  came back home and and finally picking up the broken pieces of myself with the
  help of my family. And this is the first project ever I've done myself from
  the start to the end. Hope that this would be the turning point to put my life
  back on the route. Never Give up !

  Today was very confusing day with ups and downs. At least till this morning, I
  was so happy that I finally get my blog work with Travis CI, which was the
  most hardest part for me. And The only thing left for me to do was just same
  designing and implementing phase for post/footer and bit of media queries to
  make the blog site responsive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Being hopeful, after lunch, I strated documenting what I've done so far in the
  project for the future reference and to record my learnings from this project.
  And it was also not that bad, I quite enjoyed writing it out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And after that, around dinner time, eveyrthing started getting hairy all of a
  sudden.. My vscode terminal starts not showing anything just being blank for
  no reason. And that completely sent me on a wild-goose chase since it turned
  out that there was nothing wrong with me, rahter it was due to some mysterious
  incompatibility existing between VS Code and my zsh theme (10k sth whatever).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Till I finally figured that out, I literally uninstalled and installed
  everything suspcious.. literally everything.. I firstly reset my zsh thinking
  i might've modified some parts accidentally and VS Code after that. In the
  end, after finding out what is the cause, i had to revert every set up env
  back to what they were which was another pain in the neck 😥😥.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Anyway... I'm just trying to think that it was an another good revision of how
  VS Code work and zsh.. (&lt;strike&gt;Nope&lt;/strike&gt;).

  Nowadays, i keep studying more than 8 hrs per day though i bludges for a while
  in the day. I think its mainly due to the blog project since it just eats up
  large chunk of time easily. And I dont think i am fully concentrated while i'm
  doing the project compared to taking a course since all i do for project is
  mostly a series of &quot;Googling &amp; Being Frustrated for a while&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Anyhow, hope i can finally finish template files for post. So, I would not
  need to manually template the post like now i'm doing. And i think i'm putting
  too much time on learning this jekyll &amp; liquid stuffs rather than practicing
  html/css/js which i originally wanted to do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I better finish this project asap so that I can practice more on html/css/js
  before moving on to js. At the moment, I'm thinking of cloning some popular
  website for practices like i was doing with starbuck page.(Hmm i probs should
  restart the project again once i finish this)

  Finally I made up my mind on a blog design. Actually for me, designing my blog
  was much harder than just coding it up since I'm kinda perfectionist :.. (
  Anyway, i couldn't keep being stuck at the designing stage forever, so i
  managed to compromised myself with a basic and commmon design structure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Before then, my imagination kinda exploded and i was thinking of lots of crazy
  themes for my blog, which must be difficult to implement as well. Those were
  simply not feasible considering my current skillset. I would probably end up
  procrastinating after all since it would be too overwhelming to implement
  those shiny stuffs I imagined at first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And... tah da~~ The image below on this post is the blog design i drew myself
  before having started buidling this blog up today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I still need to change a bit of details on Latest Posts section and might add
  some more components to it but anyway.. At least it got me going and I'm glad
  i've moved on with this design. Not sure how my blog would look like to others
  yet, but at least to me it looks cool (my baby.. of course)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I probably should work more on DS/Algo tomorrow though.. since i've been
  neglecting the subject since this blog project took too much time than i
  expected.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Then .. this is all for today. Hope that i wouldn't need to manually format my
  daily post md file soon !! Gnight :))

  Today I was totally burnt out especially in the evening so i couldn't study
  enough for ds &amp; algo on leetcode.
  &lt;br /&gt;
  I feel like i should be more consistent. Take time and do things one by one. I
  will get there some day if i don't give up in the middle being burnt out.

&lt;!-- excerpt-start --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Today, I finally started building my own blog, which has been always on my
  to-do-list, but never dare to start at least till yesterday. So, I wasn't
  planning to do this today at all though i thought i will at some point in the
  future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Initially, I simply thought that my front-end dev skills aren't good enough
  yet to build a blog wesbite since I'm actually still at a very early stage of
  front-end development. I just had finished the basics of HTML and CSS(Sass)
  course 2 days ago.
&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;
  Still, I kept thinking that I really need to blog my daily life or learning
  for many reasons. First one I could think of was that it might help me to get
  a job in the future since the recruiters might want to know how I've been
  studying so far and they would be able to check those easily from my blog.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  But, more than anything, it was to calm me down from being depressed and
  feeling anxious. I think I studied not that bad last month, but I kept feeling
  worried if I've been doing alright. So, I had to keep checking where I'm up to
  and how much i've done so far. And after a few days in that same mood, I
  finally realised that I need something visual to show the workloads I've done
  and the thing could be my blog since i will record my daily learning there and
  be able to check them easily if i want to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Anyway, so i tried buidling damn blog today. My original thought was to finish
  building it today within a few hours and how naive I was !! 😂😂 I already got
  stuck with installing ruby on my WSL, which was very painful. I bumped into
  lot of diffrent error messages which i barely could understand at all. I
  literally spent all my morning time wiht installing damn ruby on my WSL.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Even after that, it again took me another few hours to figure out how jekyll
  exactly works with its own structure and liquid, which i've never seen before.
  Anyway, I finally figured it out now and its almost 12am 😥😥. And my blog
  website still looks very humble.. compared to my ambitious one in my
  imagination. Whatever :(( I still have a week right? (I changed my plan, so i
  will try building it up for a week)
  &lt;br /&gt;
  Ok, I better wrap it up here since I have tommorow to start!
&lt;/p&gt;
