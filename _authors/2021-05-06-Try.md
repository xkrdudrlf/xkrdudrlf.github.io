Finally I made up my mind on a blog design. Actually for me, designing my blog was much harder than just coding it up since I'm kinda perfectionist :.. ( Anyway, i couldn't keep being stuck at the designing stage forever, so i managed to compromised myself with a basic and commmon design structure.
<br><br>
Before then, my imagination kinda exploded and i was thinking of lots of crazy themes for my blog, which must be difficult to implement as well. Those were simply not feasible considering my current skillset. I would probably end up procrastinating after all since it would be too overwhelming to implement those shiny stuffs I imagined at first.
<br><br>
And... tah da~~ The image below on this post is the blog design i drew myself before having started buidling this blog up today.
<br><br>
I still need to change a bit of details on Latest Posts section and might add some more components to it but anyway.. At least it got me going and I'm glad i've moved on with this design. Not sure how my blog would look like to others yet, but at least to me it looks cool (my baby.. of course)
<br><br>
I probably should work more on DS/Algo tomorrow though.. since i've been neglecting the subject since this blog project took too much time than i expected.
<br><br>
Then .. this is all for today. Hope that i wouldn't need to manually format my daily post md file soon !! Gnight :))
