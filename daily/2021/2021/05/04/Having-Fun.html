  Finally I made up my mind on a blog design. Actually for me, designing my blog
  was much harder than just coding it up since I'm kinda perfectionist :.. (
  Anyway, i couldn't keep being stuck at the designing stage forever, so i
  managed to compromised myself with a basic and commmon design structure.
  <br />
  Before then, my imagination kinda exploded and i was thinking of lots of crazy
  themes for my blog, which must be difficult to implement as well. Those were
  simply not feasible considering my current skillset. I would probably end up
  procrastinating after all since it would be too overwhelming to implement
  those shiny stuffs I imagined at first.
  <br />
  And... tah da~~ The image below on this post is the blog design i drew myself
  before having started buidling this blog up today.
  <br />
  I still need to change a bit of details on Latest Posts section and might add
  some more components to it but anyway.. At least it got me going and I'm glad
  i've moved on with this design. Not sure how my blog would look like to others
  yet, but at least to me it looks cool (my baby.. of course)
  <br />
  I probably should work more on DS/Algo tomorrow though.. since i've been
  neglecting the subject since this blog project took too much time than i
  expected.
  <br />
  Then .. this is all for today. Hope that i wouldn't need to manually format my
  daily post md file soon !! Gnight :))
