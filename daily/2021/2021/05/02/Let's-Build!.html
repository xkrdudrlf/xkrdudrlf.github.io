<div style="padding-left: 15px;">
  Today, I finally started building my own blog, which has been always on my to-do-list, but never dare to start at least till yesterday. So, I wasn't planning to do this today at all though i thought i will at some point in the future.
  <br /><br /> 
  Initially, I simply thought that my front-end dev skills aren't good enough yet to build a blog wesbite since I'm actually still at a very early stage of front-end development. I just had finished the basics of HTML and CSS(Sass) course 2 days ago.
  <br /><br />
  Still, I kept thinking that I really need to blog my daily life or learning for many reasons. First one I could think of was that it might help me to get a job in the future since the recruiters might want to know how I've been studying so far and they would be able to check those easily from my blog.
  <br /><br />
  But, more than anything, it was to calm me down from being depressed and feeling anxious. I think I studied not that bad last month, but I kept feeling worried if I've been doing alright. So, I had to keep checking where I'm up to and how much i've done so far. And after a few days in that same mood, I finally realised that I need something visual to show the workloads I've done and the thing could be my blog since i will record my daily learning there and be able to check them easily if i want to.
  <br /><br />
  Anyway, so i tried buidling damn blog today. My original thought was to finish building it today within a few hours and how naive I was !! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I already got stuck with installing ruby on my WSL, which was very painful. I bumped into lot of diffrent error messages which i barely could understand at all. I literally spent all my morning time wiht installing damn ruby on my WSL.
  <br /><br />
  Even after that, it again took me another few hours to figure out how jekyll exactly works with its own structure and liquid, which i've never seen before. Anyway, I finally figured it out now and its almost 12am ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥. And my blog website still looks very humble.. compared to my ambitious one in my imagination. Whatever :(( I still have a week right? (I changed my plan, so i will try building it up for a week) 
  <br /><br />
  Ok, I better wrap it up here since I have tommorow to start!
